## What is Kubernetes
***
### Intro 
Last time, I posted about Docker, and It's time to learn about Kubernetes.
What is Kubernetes and what causes the creation of K8S and how to use it?
First of all, Kubernetes is the open source platform to manage containered application, netwoking and storage.
It support the method of declaring deploy to define how the application and resouces in Cluster should be woring so that the state is working as like it is defined.
You can use not only with command line but also with code to manage the resource.
Kubernetes does 1. deploy and scaling of the applicaion, 2. Rooling update 3. automatic recovery

### Cluster Architecture

**Control plane** 
* Responsible for managing and coordinating the cluster's overall state.
 In AKS, when you make a Cluster, the Controle plane is automatically created. While you don't have direct access to the control plane components in AKS, you can still use kubectl to manege your cluster.
  
  | Name                    | Des |
  |-------------------------|-----|
  | kube-apiserver          |     |
  | etcd                    | 테스트2 |
  | kube-scheduler          | 테스트2 |
  | kube-controller-manager | 테스트2 |

**Node**
* Woker machines that host and run containerized applications.
* In AKS, there is more than one node and Azure VM that execute the container runtime.

  | Name                    | Des |
  |-------------------------|-----|
  | kubelet                 |     |
  | kube-proxy              | 테스트2 |
  | container-runtime       | 테스트2 |

**Interaction Example**
1. User or application interacts with the cluster through the API Server.
2. The API server receives instructions and updates the cluster state in etcd
3. Controller Manager monitors the cluster state and takes actions to maintain desired configurations.
4. Scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
5. Kubelet on each node receives pod specifications and ensures they are running.
6. Kube-proxy maneges networking for pods and services.


### Key Concepts ###
**Pod**
* The basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers.
* Group of application container and shared resource of the container, example, Volume and network

**Service**
* A way to group pods and provide a stable endpoint for cimmunication.
* To access to Pods, IP address is needed but it is changing whenever the pod is recreated(restarted). -> Service support stable address for the pod or pods croup.
* Cluster IP : 파드들이 클러스터 내부의 다른 리소스들과 통신할 수 있도록 해주는 가상의 클러스터 전용 IP

* NodePort : 외부에서 노드 IP의 특정 포트로 들어오는 요청을 감지하여, 해당 포트와 연결된 파드로 트래픽을 전달

* Load Balancer

**Volume**
파드가 사라지더라고 저장/보존이 가능하며 파드에서 사용할 수 있는 디렉터리를 제공

**Namespace**

**Deployment**
A mechanism for managing the lifecycle of pods, ensuring desired numbers are running.
